                        <li>
                    We’ll prepare the assignment.
                    We’ll help you write out a clear assignment, which we then divide into individual tasks.

                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <li>
                    We’ll select the tasks for preparation.
                    Together we’ll select the set of tasks to be delivered in this sprint.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                    We implement individual tasks end-to-end.
                    The task is completed as a whole (including initial analysis, UI design, its own technical implementation, tests and deployment of new functionality).

                    </li>


                    <li>
                        At the end of every sprint, you’ll get a new version of the functioning application. This allows us to respond quickly to changes in priorities on your side.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        We’ll accept and present all tasks with you.
                        Individual tasks are completedonly when you’re 100% satisfied. So you always know what you’re paying for.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        We’ll identify ways to make our cooperation more effective.
                        We evaluate the current cooperation to identify places where we can improve things and make them more effective.
                        We’ll plan the work for the next sprint.
                    </li>

                <span class="section__main-title">Flexible contract</span>
                <p>
                We’ll try out our cooperation in the beginning. The result of the first sprint is a functional prototype. If you’re not satisfied with our cooperation, we can end the cooperation or reconfigure it.
                We only end the project by mutual agreement. Contracts are flexible with a 1-3 month notice period. At the same time, our procedures guarantee that anyone else can pick up up on our work where we ended it.

                <span class="section__main-title">Benefits of our approach</span>
                <p>
                    You always know exactly what you’re paying for.
                    You can flexibly change your priorities during development.
                    Changes during the project are orders of magnitude less expensive compared to the fixed-time fixed-price approach.
                    The result of every sprint is a functional part of the application.
                    Deadlines apply and they’re not a prediction from a crystal ball.
